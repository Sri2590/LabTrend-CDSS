MoSCoW Prioritization – LabTrend-CDSS
Must Have (Core, non-negotiable)

These features are essential for the system to function as a Clinical Decision Support System.

User Login & Authentication
Required to ensure secure, role-based access to the system.

Role-Based Access Control (Clinician, Lab Technician, Admin)
Required to separate responsibilities and enforce governance.

Patient Search & Patient Summary View
Required to identify patients and review consolidated lab information.

Lab Data Entry (Manual & CSV Upload)
Required to populate the system with laboratory data.

Lab Input Validation
Required to ensure correctness, unit consistency, and data quality.

Lab Trend Visualization
Required to interpret lab values over time rather than as isolated results.

Risk Stratification Generation
Required to provide early disease risk screening and decision support.

👉 Justification:
Without these features, the system cannot meet its primary objective of lab-based decision support.

Should Have (Important but not blocking)

These features significantly improve usability and clinical value but are not mandatory for core functionality.

Risk Explanation View
Improves transparency and interpretability of risk outputs.

Alerts for Abnormal Labs / High Risk
Helps clinicians prioritize attention but is not required for basic risk computation.

Audit Logs
Important for traceability and accountability, especially in healthcare contexts.

Export Patient Summary Reports (PDF/Print)
Useful for sharing and documentation but not essential for internal use.

👉 Justification:
The system can function without these, but overall quality and professionalism are reduced.

Could Have (Enhancements if time permits)

These features add sophistication but are not expected in the first version.

Rule Version Comparison
Allows comparison of risk outcomes across rule changes.

Dashboard Analytics (Counts, Trends, KPIs)
Useful for admin insights but not essential for individual patient review.

Anonymized Demo Mode
Helpful for demonstrations but not required for functional correctness.

👉 Justification:
These features are value-adds and will be implemented only if time allows.

Won’t Have (Explicitly out of scope for this version)

These features are intentionally excluded to control scope and complexity.

EHR / Hospital System Integration
Requires external APIs, compliance, and real patient data.

Machine Learning-Based Prediction
Out of scope due to explainability, training data, and ethical constraints.

Mobile Application
Web-based access is sufficient for the current academic scope.

👉 Justification:
Excluding these features prevents scope creep and ensures timely delivery.
